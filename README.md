# odin-recipes

In this project, I followed the instructions provided by "The Odin Project" and worked with HTML to create a webpage with my favorite recipes. This helped me refresh my previous knowledge and learn how to use Git and GitHub. I used headings, lists, links, and images, and I made sure to indent each line correctly. It was a fun and interesting experience.
